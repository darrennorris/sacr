Description: Provides functions for the demographic analysis of 
    river turtle management options. 
    Functions are organized by name in three groups: 
    "prep.." , "Pop..." and "res..." .
    "prep.." are functions used to generate spatial layers 
    (vector and raster files), with countries, catchments, rivers,
    protected areas and human accessibility.
    "Pop..." are functions used for modelling population demographics.
    "res..." are functions used to generate results, 
    producing tables and figures.
